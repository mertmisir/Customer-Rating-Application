Some Important Notes Regarding the Application:

1. When you open up this project, you will see there is a DatabaseStorage class which is responsible for storing data regarding 
     customer. It works in my localhost without any password. Only user name(root) and the database is MySQL. Therefore, if you
     want to make this database work, you just need to download XAMPP Server with a user name and create a database and table that 
     includes 9 attributes(can be seen from my private data member inside Customer.java class) for customer. 

2. I have provided couple of snapshots in case you could not set up the database just to demonstate that everything functions 
     properly.
